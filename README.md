An example of implementing a quartic regression in C using the Gauss-Newton algorithm. 

The Jacobian example is inverted using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm and a learning rate is applied 
to the parameter iteration step to slow down large steps in parameter space, similarly to as is done
in other learning models.
